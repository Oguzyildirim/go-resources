This project is a *work in progress*. The implementation is *incomplete* and
subject to change. The documentation can be inaccurate.

openrisc
========

This project contains code related to the [OpenRISC][] architecture. The initial
aim is to provide an interface for encoding and decoding instructions, based on
the [OpenRISC 1000][] architecture specification.

It would be interesting to implement an emulator capable of running these
instructions in the future.
